			<h2>observations</h2>
			<p>Observed behavior of three users at the startling Home Depot self-checkout machine.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col2">
			<ol>
				<li><h3>The first user only paid for two water bottles. They struggled to find the bar code on the first bottle, but having scanned it were able to quickly scan the second bar code. They used no coupons and paid with a credit card, and were able to quickly pay for their items. They kept their receipt.</h3></li>
				<li><h3>The second user paid for a large number of items, including at least a dozen pieces of PVC pipe for a school project. The user had some trouble finding and scanning the bar codes on their set of PVP pipes, which were individual pieces. Scanning each item took the user a few minutes. Additionally, since the self-checkout station requires that each item be placed on the surface before scanning another, the user had to wait an extra few seconds between items before scanning. Once the user had scanned their items, they quickly paid with a credit card and kept their receipt.</h3></li>
				<li><h3>The third user paid for a gallon of paint. They accidentally scanned the paint twice, and required the assistance of a Home Depot employee to reset the process. This took a few minutes. After the user had correctly scanned their item, they tried to pay with credit card, but their card was declined â€” they then used another card and the payment went through. They kept their receipt.</h3></li>

			<h2>Hurried Henry</h2>
			<p><span style="font-weight:  bold">Henry is a college student who needs to create an architectural model for class within the next two days.</span> He has not worked much with wood or tools and while he has a list of things he needs, he is not confident while shopping for supplies at Home Depot. He has a ton to do and needs to get started on the building immediately. He has purchased many individual sheets of wood without clear barcodes, as well as glue he isn't sure is right for the job, and various knives, and has trouble scanning his items, especially in his rushed state. Henry represents Home Depot customers who need supplies for one-time projects, who aren't very experienced with the materials they are buying, and who are in a hurry on a tight timeline.</p>

			<h2>Regular Ronda</h2>
			<p><span style="font-weight:  bold">Ronda is an independent interior painter who regularly purchases materials from Home Depot every month.</span> She relies on her membership discount to save a significant amount of money. She normally pays at a register, but today tries a self-checkout station because Home Depot is irregularly busy.  When she arrives at the station, she first looks for a way to enter her membership ID to confirm she can still use her discount, but the station only says "Start scanning." She must confirm that she can use the discount. She represents Home Depot's population of customers who are regulars and use Home Depot's rewards/coupons/membership programs to save, and therefore require a more complex interaction with the self-checkout station.</p>
